In truth, this is a great northern Italian city with as many faces as a fashionista. Leonardo da Vinci lived here for a while. You can visit the very vineyard where he relaxed while painting the Last Supper. Tickets can be hard to obtain for this most famous of meals, so it\u2019s best to plan in advance. Afterwards, visit the Leonardo3 Museum, where you can learn more about the master\u2019s life and see models of his creations. Milan rewards walking. From the Piazza Duomo, you can tour the colossal cathedral, the monumental Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, majestic La Scala and the old district of La Brera. Sforzesco Castle is a little further if you\u2019d like to see the grandeur of Milan\u2019s ruling dukes, while the city\u2019s art galleries are a real treat for their permanent and ever-changing temporary exhibitions. If you need more labels in your life, take off the tracksuit and stroll the exclusive Via Monte Napoleone. Then, when you tire of past glories, go to the brand new Piazza Gae Aulenti to see the Unicredit Tower designed by architect C\u00e9sar Pell. Beyond the city center, Milan\u2019s districts offer different perspectives. Navigli is a cool network of canals whose bars and restaurants cast dancing reflections off the water at night. The previously blue-collar neighborhood of Isola has been reborn as a leafy oasis of notable street art, cafes, bars, boutiques, galleries and clubs \u2013 basically, hipster central. Citta Studi around Piazza Leonardo is where the students congregate, and therefore where you\u2019ll find some good craft beers.
